# ROBOTWORLD — agent onboarding

Browser 3D mech arena fighter (Three.js + Vite, plain ES modules, no TS).
12 mechs, 12 destructible arenas, 4-player local multiplayer (KB + Xbox
pads), AI opponents, procedural everything (models, textures, animation,
audio). Progress history: `TASKS.md`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173 · `npm run build` (must stay green)
- Headless screenshot: `node tools/shot.mjs "<url>" out.png <waitMs>` —
  SwiftShader runs the game ~20× slow; use waits from MECH_ART_GUIDE §4 and
  VIEW the images, don't assume.
- Combat crash soak: `node tools/soak.mjs "http://localhost:5173/?battle=neon&p1=titanus&p2=viper&auto=1&diff=ace"`
- Debug URLs: `?showcase` (12-mech lineup) · `?showcase=<id>&anim=<clip|walk|none>`
  (single mech, judging camera) · `?battle=<arena>&p1=<id>&p2=<id>[&p3..p4][&auto=1][&diff=ace][&forcesplit=1]`
  · `?rigtest` (GLB retarget math check) · `?showall=1` (force SETTINGS → SHOW
  ALL ROBOTS on for the session)
- WORKBENCHES LIVE ON THEIR OWN PAGE: `/workbench/?edit=<tool>&mech=<id>` —
  `animation` (procedural-vs-GLB action comparison + anchor editor),
  `pose` (joints + clip keyframes), `gait` (the walk/run cycle's own dials),
  `skin` (bone-island repair),
  `skindebug` (the SKIN AUDIT — see below), `rig`
  (hand-placed skeletons), `collider` (what combat hits), `props`
  (the IMPORTED ARENA PROP MODELS, original vs optimized in twin viewports
  sharing one camera — `?edit=props&prop=<name>`, no `&mech=`). A bare
  `/workbench/` (or an unknown `?edit=`) lands on a card-per-tool front page
  with screenshots (`workbench/landing.js`; re-shoot with
  `node tools/wbthumbs.mjs`). `&variant=alt`
  (legacy `&alt=1`) opens a mech's alternate build. The OLD urls
  (`?debug=models|pose|skin|collider`, `?rigedit=<id>`) still work — they
  redirect, carrying their params, so every tools/*.mjs script and bookmark is
  unaffected.
- The workbench code is a separate tree (`workbench/`) that knows the game
  ONLY through a config object: `workbench/config/contract.js` documents the
  whole surface, `workbench/adapters/robotworld/` fills it in by DERIVING from
  live game data (roster, clips, joint order, rig registry, manifest) — add a
  mech or a clip and the workbenches pick it up with no edit there.
  `node tools/wbconfig.mjs` proves nothing has been hand-copied. Tools under
  `workbench/tools/` import no game code at all. See `workbench/README.md`.
- SKIN DEBUG (`/workbench/?edit=skindebug&mech=<id>`) is the AUDIT workbench: it
  plays every clip a mech can play (plus its rest stance), CPU-skins the model at
  each sampled frame, and ranks every place the skin fails — `stretch` (an edge
  dragged past its built length), `pinch` (an edge collapsed — the LBS candy
  wrapper), `tear` (a weld seam pulled apart, which opens a crack through the
  model). Only edges whose two ends carry DIFFERENT weights are sampled, since
  nothing else can change length; the reference is the BIND pose, and the rest
  stance is scanned as its own clip so skin that is already broken standing
  still is one finding rather than a mark on all forty. A FINDING IS A PLACE ON
  THE MODEL, not a place in a clip: spots that touch on the mesh are merged and
  each finding lists the clips it fails in (dropdown), because one bad weight
  fails in every animation that moves that bone and forty rows all fixed by one
  rebind is not a list anyone can work. ◀ ▶ (or arrow keys) walk the findings,
  SPACE plays the clip at 0.1-1x with the failing edges highlighted live on the
  deforming geometry, H toggles the highlight, F frames the spot; findings can be
  marked fixed/ignored (localStorage). The three buttons hand the fix to the tool
  that owns it, in a new tab — **Edit skin** with the failing island already
  selected (`&vert=`) and the clip in its wiggle picker, **Edit rig**, **Edit
  pose** on that clip at that frame (`&clip=&t=`). **Load from manifest**
  re-reads `models/manifest.json` and drops the cached GLBs (skinOps are baked
  into the shared geometry once), so a save from the skin workbench next door is
  picked up and re-scanned without losing your place. Headless twin:
  `node tools/skindebug.mjs <mech> [--json out.json]`. The maths lives in
  `workbench/tools/stretchscan.js`; the narrower CLI probes
  (`tools/skinstretch.mjs`, `tools/cliptear.mjs`, `tools/stretchaudit.mjs`)
  still answer their own questions.
- Every workbench side panel (skin/models/pose/collider/rigedit + the level
  editor's two) is RESIZABLE: drag its outer edge, double-click the handle to
  reset, width remembered per tool (`src/dev/panelui.js`, which also styles
  their scrollbars). Widen it when a bone/op name ellipsizes.
- Workbenches: `?debug=models[&mech=<id>]` — procedural-vs-GLB ACTION
  comparison (trigger any move on both at once, slow-mo, live anchor editor).
  `?debug=pose[&mech=<id>][&model=glb|proc][&clip=<name>][&key=<n>|&t=<s>]` —
  pose a single mech by joint: load one of THAT mech's own clip poses as a
  starting point,
  CLICK A JOINT IN THE VIEWPORT (the dots, or just the body part — nearest
  joint wins; R/T rotate/translate, G local/world, Esc deselect) and drag the
  gizmo. It EDITS THE CLIP, not just a pose: the loaded clip becomes its authored
  key list again, a drag is written into whichever key you're parked on, and the
  scrubber plays YOUR version back. Drag the scrubber and clip time runs smoothly
  (the motion preview); let go and it SNAPS to the nearest key, since a key is the
  only place an edit can be stored — between keys the readout says `between keys`
  and nothing is editable. PLAY (beside the key steppers, or Space) runs the clip
  at 1× on a loop through the real animator — pausing snaps back to the nearest
  key. ◀ key / key ▶ step them, key times are listed under the
  slider, `&key=<n>`/`&t=<s>` deep-link one, and it opens on the LAST key (the
  held pose of a hold/loop clip, the RECOVERY of a one-shot strike). The KEY
  TRACK under the scrubber edits the key LIST itself: DRAG a diamond to move
  that key in time (clamped between its neighbours), RIGHT-CLICK bare track for
  "New keyframe" (born EMPTY, so it changes nothing until you drag a joint on
  it), RIGHT-CLICK a diamond or press DEL/BACKSPACE to delete it. Amber = the
  selected key, green = differs from the shipped clip; all of it is undoable
  and reported in the export (`movedFrom`, `addedKey`, `deletedKeys`). An edit is
  stored as the DELTA you dragged applied to what the key AUTHORS — never the
  on-screen numbers assigned outright, since signature motion and rest bias ride
  on top of those — and keys stay SPARSE, so only the joints you touched are
  added. "Revert clip edits" restores the shipped clip. "Copy pose" then exports
  the WHOLE key list: `keys[]` with a per-joint `changed: {from, to}` on each
  edited key, `editedKeys`, and `js` — the key list already formatted for
  `animations.js`. UNDO/REDO (Ctrl/⌘+Z · Ctrl/⌘+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y, plus buttons)
  covers every edit, reset and clip swap; steps are deduped by content, so
  scrubbing and key-stepping never flood the stack, and a mech/GLB/alt rebuild
  clears it (different rig, so old transforms mean nothing).
  "Bind patch" emits the GLB manifest
  `boneCorrections`/`bonePos`. "Apply constraints" (default on) is the
  animation framework's rule — rotation only, hips may also translate — so
  limbs can't be stretched into a pose no clip could reproduce.
  `?debug=collider[&mech=<id>][&model=glb|proc][&clip=<name>][&at=hit]
  [&dummy=<dist|0>][&ball=0]` — what combat actually HITS: the measured
  hurtbox capsules (green), the legacy `hitRadius` ball they replaced (red),
  and the swept striking limb at a clip's hit frame (yellow), against a
  second mech at an adjustable distance. `contain`/`bloat` in the readout
  are the fit metrics; `node tools/hurtboxfit.mjs` prints them for the whole
  roster on both routes, and `node tools/hitprobe.mjs "<battle url>"` reports
  the new melee test against the old one on a real fight.
- GAITS ARE DATA (`src/mechs/gaits.js`): the walk/run cycle is a NAMED table —
  `standard` (the default), `sprint` (the fast tier: viper, tempest, wraith,
  nova) and `quad` (fenrir's gallop, a `quad` block over the same biped layer).
  A roster def names one with `gait: '<id>'` and mechs SHARE them, so tuning a
  gait moves every mech that runs it. `applyGait()` is the whole cycle and is
  PURE — the animator runs it and so does the gait workbench, so what is tuned
  there is what ships. Each dial has a `*Run` twin (`base + run * ratio`), which
  is how one gait walks politely and sprints hard. Add a dial by adding it to
  `GAIT_SCHEMA` + reading it in `applyGait` — the workbench's sliders, its
  "which dial moves this limb" logic and `tools/wbconfig.mjs` all derive from
  the schema. THE ONE RULE THAT IS NOT A CURVE: a raised REAR foot must point its
  toes back and down, never forward — a level sole in mid-air reads as walking on
  a floor that isn't there. `applyToeHang` runs LAST (after the gallop layer) and
  SOLVES for it: `ankle.hang` is the radians below horizontal the toes end up at
  (π/2 = straight down, more = back), and the pass subtracts whatever the hips,
  thigh and knee already contribute, so one number lands the same on a boot, a
  talon and a paw. Its window is read off the POSE, not the phase — the leg
  behind its rest direction AND the foot lifted off its standing height (both, or
  a foot still pushing off gets its toe driven through the pavement) — which is
  why it also works for fenrir, whose hinds are moved by two layers at different
  rates. The same weight releases the flat-sole levelling, which used to cancel
  the whole leg chain for the entire cycle. Judge a change with `node tools/gaitprobe.mjs <mech> [throttle]
  [vsGait]` (foot reach/stride/lift/track/lean measured off the posed model,
  diffed against another gait) and `node tools/gaitsheet.mjs <mech> out.png
  [throttle] [frames] [vsGait]` (the cycle as a filmstrip, comparison ghost in
  every frame).
- THE GAIT WORKBENCH (`/workbench/?edit=gait&mech=<id>`) runs one mech ON THE
  SPOT with every gait dial live. THREE speed knobs, deliberately separate:
  THROTTLE (how fast the mech is moving — what `ratio` and the foot cadence
  read), GAME SPEED (the player-facing ROBOT SPEED setting, 50-200%) and
  ANIMATION SPEED (slow-motion for reading a fast cycle; changes nothing about
  the gait). Pause + a phase scrubber (`[`/`]`) freeze a moment of the stride; a
  phase-locked GHOST beside the mech runs the SHIPPED gait — or any other gait,
  which is how a mech is moved between gaits with eyes open. The mech dropdown
  names each mech's gait, the panel lists every other mech running it (click one
  to load that body with your edits intact — edits belong to the gait, not the
  mech), and CLICKING A LIMB then DRAGGING IT tunes the dial behind it: the tool
  measures d(joint)/d(dial) at that phase, works out which way that pushes the
  limb on screen and projects the drag onto it. TYPING beats the slider: a dial's
  number box takes values PAST the slider's ends (the range is the sane band, not
  a limit) and marks itself amber when it is outside what the handle can reach.
  **Output gait** downloads a paste-ready `GAITS` block with every changed dial
  listed from -> to.
  FOOTPRINTS (on by default, `&prints=0` off) run the GROUND instead of the
  mech: each plant stamps a print where the foot landed and the floor, prints
  and grid together, scrolls backward at the real ground speed. The gap between
  two prints of the same foot is the stride MEASURED rather than derived (the
  readout prints both, and they agreeing is the no-skate proof), the sideways
  offset is the track, and a stance foot sliding off its own print is a cadence
  that doesn't match the speed.
- THE MANNEQUIN (`src/mechs/mannequin.js`) is a REFERENCE HUMANOID on the game's
  own 15 joints — same hierarchy, same measurements as the mech it stands in for
  (`factory.buildRig`/`computeDims`), built as a genuine SkinnedMesh with real
  weights: one flat colour per bone (WARM = left, COOL = right, darker further
  out the limb), a foot with a real heel behind the ankle and a toe box in front,
  a nose and eyes on the head, a thumb on each hand. It answers "where is this
  part SUPPOSED to be" in four workbenches: **gait** and **pose** offer it as a
  third BUILD button beside GLB/Procedural (it runs the mech's own gait and
  poses the same clips — per-mech signature motion is off, so what you see is the
  shared engine); **skin** has a `Mannequin reference` box that loads it as the
  subject, read-only, to show the layout a repaired bind is aiming at (one
  contiguous island per bone, seam at each joint, a narrow blend band across it);
  **rig** ghosts it over the raw model at the model's own height as an X-RAY with
  every joint NAMED on screen (`config.reference.mannequin/labels`), which is how
  "the ankle is above and forward of the heel" stops being a guess — and there it
  wears TWO HATS, switched by the `match this rig's bones` box under it: ticked
  (the default) it stands in YOUR bone positions, the humanoid your skeleton
  describes, following live as you drag; unticked it stands in its own canonical
  stance, the answer key for where each joint belongs. Both halves of a joint are
  matched — position lands on the bone, rotation aims the segment at the next
  joint down, so it bends its knee instead of sliding its shin.
  It is also A SUBJECT IN ITS OWN RIGHT — **MANNEQUIN** sits at the bottom of
  every workbench's mech dropdown, under the rule with the work-in-progress
  mechs, so it can be opened on its own. It is NOT game content: `MANNEQUIN_DEF`
  lives in mannequin.js, never in ROSTER, so mech select, RANDOM picks, CPU picks
  and the title line-up have never heard of it. The adapter declares it
  (`catalogue.reference()`), which is how `tools/wbconfig.mjs` still proves the
  catalogue matches ROSTER, how the ACTION workbench leaves it out (it drives real
  Fighters, and a reference body has no moves), and how skin/rig refuse to save
  over it. In the rig editor its own canonical skeleton IS the rig — 15 bones
  already where they belong, as the answer key for the mech you are rigging.
  Combat's hurtbox measures it too: `measureHurtbox` picks the SKIN path off the
  model's shape (`boneMap` + `skeleton`) rather than off "is it a GLB", so the
  reference body reports its 15 capsules — no shipped mech's numbers move
  (`node tools/hurtboxfit.mjs` is byte-identical before and after).
- WELDED PARTS — when no reskinning can fix it: an auto-mesher returns ONE
  shell, so two parts that sit close at bind pose (jerry's claw-arm wrists
  against his shell) get triangles running between them. Rebinding cannot help,
  the geometry itself says they are one surface, and the loser is dragged across
  the arena. `seamCuts` in a manifest entry cuts them apart
  (`src/mechs/seamcut.js`, applied straight after skinOps so it reads the FINAL
  weights): `"seamCuts": [{"a":["handL","handR"],"b":["torso"],"cap":true}]`.
  Each bridging triangle goes to the side carrying more of its weight, corners
  belonging to the other side become DUPLICATE vertices bound to the side that
  took them, cross-side weights are stripped, and both rims are CAPPED with a
  lid (own vertices, own flat normal, wound from the rim's own directed edges).
  Nothing moves at bind pose — the duplicates sit on top of the originals — so a
  poster/showcase render is untouched; the cut only appears when the joint does.
  Distinct from reskin.js' `cutWelds`, which DELETES the triangles: that is right
  for a hidden membrane spanning an air gap (rhino), wrong for visible shell.
  The skin audit knows a deliberate split from a crack (`seamId`/`seamSide` on
  the geometry) and skips it, reporting the count instead.
  Find them with `node tools/weldmap.mjs <mech> --list` (every bone pair that
  shares a triangle despite being far apart in the skeleton — a real armour
  joint is 1 link, an elbow welded to a thigh is 4) and `node tools/weldmap.mjs
  <mech> --pairs a~b` to render one: the welded triangles highlighted at bind
  pose beside the frame that abuses them most. Pairs already separated by a
  seamCut drop off the list, so it doubles as the check that a cut worked.
- Alternate GLBs: a manifest entry may carry a standalone `alt` sub-entry —
  a second model, or the same model on a staged custom rig. `?debug=skin`,
  `?debug=pose`, `?debug=collider` and `?rigedit` all show an **Edit
  Alternate GLB** checkbox for any mech that has one (off by default;
  `&alt=1` in the URL; `?debug=models` reaches the same build through its
  COMPARE TO dropdown, which stands alt beside the primary). When a mech's
  custom rig lives ONLY on its `alt` (inferno, rhino), `?rigedit=<id>` opens
  that build instead of refusing, with the box ticked and disabled. Shared
  logic: `src/dev/altpick.js`.
- Every mech dropdown goes through `subjectSelect` (`workbench/ui/subjectpick.js`),
  which orders them ALPHABETICALLY and puts the `hidden` work-in-progress mechs
  under a rule at the end — the catalogue's own order is the roster's design
  order, which is right for a line-up and useless for finding one mech in
  seventeen. Tools that want bare ids instead of display names pass
  `label: (id) => id`; the ordering rule stays in one place either way.
- Workbench chrome is shared: `src/dev/panelui.js` owns the resizable panel,
  its scrollbars AND the coloured title bar every workbench wears (pose
  green · skin orange · animation purple · rig blue · collider cyan · gait
  amber, with a
  live `mech · ALT · GLB` subtitle) — add a tool to `WORKBENCHES` and pass
  `workbench:'<id>'` to `setupDevPanel`. The chevron beside the title SWITCHES
  WORKBENCH, carrying the current mech (and its staged variant) over; each
  `WORKBENCHES` entry names its `?edit=` id in `tool`, which is why two keys
  can keep their old names (`models` = animation, `rigedit` = rig). `src/dev/mechpick.js` owns the mech
  dropdown: `mechSelect()` for tools that rebuild in place, `gotoMech()` for
  `?rigedit`, which builds its world around one id and so switches by
  navigating.
- THE RIG EDITOR'S **T POSE** box (`/workbench/?edit=rig`) drives the whole
  skeleton into a canonical T — arms straight out along the shoulder line, legs
  straight down — which is the one-frame answer to "how accurately can this rig
  pose the mech": an ankle on a hock or a thigh aimed outboard shows up
  immediately, and the mannequin beside it (above) holds the same T as the shape
  it was aiming at. A body with no humanoid T (cranky's pincers, his leg arches)
  will stretch, and that IS the reading.
  IT IS EDITABLE, which is the point — judge the neutral pose and fix it in the
  same place. A drag under the T pose is still a BIND edit: the gizmo only ever
  writes `bone.position`, which IS the bind offset from the parent (the pose sets
  rotations and nothing else), and it writes it in the parent's POSED frame, so
  you push the limb where you want it while looking at the limb. On release the
  editor drops every rotation, reads the positions back at the bind pose, re-binds
  the skin THERE and re-applies the T — so the pose is never baked into the bind,
  and the mesh deforming live under the drag is feedback, not a save. The lateral
  axis comes from the rig's own shoulder (then hip) line, so it works whichever
  way a mesh faces.
- WHICH WAY THE REFERENCE FACES: the mannequin is built in the GAME's frame
  (`factory.buildRig` — faces +z, left at -x) while a rig file is authored in the
  RAW GLB's bind space, which faces +x with left at +z (the manifest `yawOffset`
  reconciles them at runtime, and the rig editor shows the raw asset, before it
  applies). Ghosted in unturned, the reference stood at 90 degrees to the mech —
  facing sideways on its own, feet and head pointing across the body while
  matching. `alignMannequinFacing` asks both bodies which way THEIR OWN left is
  (`up x left = forward`) and yaws the group by the difference, which also gets
  the MANNEQUIN-as-subject case right (the frames already agree; the answer is 0).
- RIG EDITOR EDITS ARE DRAFTS. Every drag/undo/add/delete goes to localStorage
  (`saveDraft`, key `rigedit:<id>`) and ONLY the **Save rig to file ▶** button
  writes `src/mechs/rigs/<id>.rig.js` (`saveRigToFile`). They were both named
  `saveRig` — two function declarations, one scope, later one wins — so for a
  while every drag POSTed the rig file to the dev server, which then fired Vite's
  HMR and reloaded the tool from under the edit. Keep the two names distinct.
- **JOINT OFFSET** mode in the rig editor (the button beside `Move`) authors
  `boneCorrections` by hand: the gizmo ROTATES instead of translating, and what
  you turn is stored as that joint's offset — degrees `[x,y,z]`, listed in the
  panel with a ✕ per joint, saved to the MANIFEST (not the rig file) or copied as
  a patch. It is how a rig says something bone positions cannot: "this thigh
  RESTS splayed, take 10 degrees out of it before any clip plays". Edits persist
  as a draft (`rigcorr:<id>`) until saved.
  THEY ARE PREVIEWED IN THAT MODE AND NOWHERE ELSE, which is a deliberate
  narrowing: 10 degrees at a hip swings an ankle most of a foot's width, so
  previewing them in the plain MOVE view stood the mech with his feet clamped
  together in the one view whose job is placing bones against the asset as it
  really is (the panel says how many are waiting instead). In the T pose they
  DOUBLE-COUNT — the T has already aimed every limb straight, so "take the splay
  out of this thigh" on top of an already-straight thigh crosses the legs — so
  the T stays the honest "what can this rig do" view. Turning the mode on with
  the T pose on shows the offsets over it, which is the comparison that matters.
  One more rule that falls out: the base a correction is measured from is the
  pose WITHOUT the offsets, so it may only ever be captured off bones that are
  not wearing them. `applyPose()` is the single entry point that guarantees it
  (clear rotations -> pose -> capture -> apply) and is idempotent; capturing from
  bones that already wear the offsets folds them into the base and lays them on
  twice, which walked the legs further across on every toggle of the mode. CAVEAT worth knowing: the editor previews the
  offset on the BIND pose while the game applies the same bone-local rotation on
  top of the ANIMATED pose, so the operation is identical but the frame it starts
  from differs by the animator's rest bias. Positions are never touched in this
  mode, so a joint offset costs no re-skin.
- BONE ROTATION: a rig file carries POSITIONS ONLY, and adding a rest rotation to
  one would change nothing — `applyCustomRig` rebinds the skin at rest
  (`rebindRest`) and `RigAdapter` captures a rest offset per bone
  (`offset = jointWorld⁻¹ · boneWorld`), so both halves cancel it out exactly.
  The rotation lever that DOES work is `boneCorrections` in the manifest: degrees
  `[x,y,z]` per joint, post-multiplied in bone-LOCAL space after the retarget.
  It applies to custom-rig mechs too (the one place RigAdapter is constructed
  reads it). On a custom rig every bone rests unrotated, so bone-local x is the
  mesh's forward axis and a rotation about it is exactly adduction — which is how
  viper's running splay was fixed: `thighL [10,0,0]` / `thighR [-10,0,0]` took his
  standing knee lean from 12.5° outboard to 2.5° and the knee-lift peak from 44°
  to 21°/37°. Measure it with `node tools/legsplay.mjs <mech>` — and measure the
  BONES, which is what that tool does: the retarget drives bone ORIENTATION from
  the game's clean humanoid, but bone POSITIONS are the rig's own, so the virtual
  joints can read 10° inboard while the rendered legs are 15° out.
- SAVING FROM A WORKBENCH (dev server only): `?debug=skin` has **Save to
  manifest** and `?rigedit` has **Save rig to file** — they write
  `public/models/manifest.json` / `src/mechs/rigs/<id>.rig.js` on this machine
  through `POST /__rw/manifest` / `/__rw/rig` (vite.config.js). Both SPLICE:
  `tools/manifestfmt.mjs` replaces one value in the JSON text, `tools/rigfmt.mjs`
  replaces only the `bones` array and keeps the header, `skinSpan`/`cutWelds`
  and the in-array comments. Saving is local — **Export uncommitted saves**
  (both tools, enabled only when the tree is dirty) downloads every uncommitted
  change as ONE `git apply`-able patch to hand over for committing.
  SKIN OPS LEAVE PINNED. `{"comp":N}` is an ordinal into the proximity partition
  the CURRENT rig draws, so a rig edit renumbers it onto other geometry without a
  word (jerry's back once landed on his foot this way; a viper skin patch
  authored on the previous rig came back selecting his elbows). The workbench
  still WORKS in islands, but Save/Export run `pinSkinOps` (skinops.js) first and
  write the vertex list each island meant — a vertex index is a property of the
  geometry, which no rig can renumber. Ops that arrive from elsewhere still
  carrying `comp` ids are only valid against the rig they were authored on: check
  them with `node tools/skindebug.mjs <mech>` before and after (the severity
  total moves the wrong way when they have shifted).
- SKIN WORKBENCH **Debug output ▶** downloads ONE self-contained HTML file for
  handing a deformation problem to someone else: two screenshots of the current
  frame (shaded + bone colours), the full tool state (mech, build, selected
  island, what is wiggling, live ops, camera) and the STRETCH MEASUREMENT at
  that exact moment — every edge over the limits, ranked, each named by vertex,
  bone and island, plus a by-bone-pair summary. The raw JSON is embedded in a
  `<script type="application/json">` block, so the file reads by eye and parses
  by machine. NOTE the caveat it prints in red: the skin workbench renders the
  RAW file (skinOps only), so `seamCuts` are NOT applied there and geometry the
  GAME has already separated still stretches in that view — wiggling jerry's
  elbow swings his hand, whose weld to the torso is cut in game and intact
  here. The panel says so whenever the loaded entry has seam cuts; judge a cut
  in Skin Debug, not in the skin workbench.
- Skin workbench selections: click = the bone-island under the cursor ·
  SHIFT-click = the BLEND PATCH (the run of geometry sharing that vertex's own
  bone plus a minority weight on another — the bit of torso that wiggles with
  an arm) · `Absorb enclaves` (E) hands every limb-bound island that sits
  inside another bone's region to the bone around it (`skinops.enclaveScan`).
  PAINT GEOMETRY (P) has three brushes: S/M/L round brush · **Loop** (screen
  lasso, paints the region verts you can SEE inside it) · **Slice** (the same
  lasso cutting THROUGH the model — near side, far side and anything buried
  between, for geometry you'd otherwise have to orbit around; the outline
  draws amber instead of violet to say so).
- A fighter grown at RUNTIME (colossus' COLOSSAL FORM ult scales him 4×) must
  tell the animation layer: `animator.sizeMul = <factor>`. Everything in
  animator.js is authored in the model's own local units, so without it the
  legs keep their small-body TIMING over four times the distance — four
  strides per stride's worth of ground, feet skating and jump-cutting. It
  scales the walk cadence (full 1/sizeMul — a planted foot must sweep at
  ground speed), the leg smoothing + a hard angular cap (1/√sizeMul — dynamic
  similarity: big limbs swing slower), and the pelvis foot-follow, whose
  world-measured clearance has to be divided back into local units or the
  correction loop runs at gain × sizeMul and rings. Measure any of it with
  `node tools/footprobe.mjs <mech> <scale>`.
- WHERE THE ANKLE BONE GOES: at the TOP OF THE SOLE PLATE — about `0.32 * scale`
  above the sole (~4.5% of body height), NOT at the lowest point of the
  geometry. It is the hinge the gait rolls the foot around, so it needs a foot
  underneath it: `Animator.calibrateFeet` measures `footDepth` (ankle above
  sole) and DAMPS the authored heel roll by `convention/depth` when the bone
  sits high (`ankleGain`, floor 0.25, plus a `footFlat` levelling ask), while at
  `depth <= 0.02` it gives up and keeps the default. `ankleGain 1.00` +
  `footFlat 0` is the target. `node tools/ankleprobe.mjs [mech …] [--chains]`
  measures sole/ankle/depth/gain for every mech on both sides and FAILS on any
  bone at or below its sole (nothing is, today); `--chains` prints the whole leg
  with each bone's share of the FOOT PLATE, which is what distinguishes an ankle
  MIS-MAPPED onto a hock (fix with `boneOverrides` — no weight moves, as
  saurion's `bone_8` -> `bone_9`) from one merely placed high (fix in the rig
  file — vulcan, wraith). Neither fix is free: moving an ankle re-draws the
  proximity partition around it, so measure `tools/skindebug.mjs` before and
  after and expect to reject some (titanus 3158 -> 11661, glacier +18%, cranky
  +32% — all left as found). `buildSkeletonBones` clamps a custom rig's bones to
  y >= 0 so a rig edit can't bury a foot under the arena floor.
- Hitboxes: `src/combat/hurtbox.js`. Bone-bound capsules measured off each
  model's own geometry, so they follow the animation; melee resolves on the
  striking hand/foot (clip `strikeArm` / `strikeLimb`, else the extremity
  leading furthest forward), and bullets/beams test the swept segment.
  `Fighter.hitRadius` is unchanged and still owns AoE falloff + broad phase.
- MELEE AUTO-AIM steers a live swing on BOTH axes, in `fighter.js`:
  `aimStrikeAt` laterally (torso twist + palm clamp) and `elevateStrikeAt` in
  HEIGHT — the striking limb is pulled into the target's CHEST-TO-CROWN band
  (`MELEE.AIM_LO`/`AIM_HI`) by pitching its shoulder (punch), thigh (kick) or
  torso (bite), so blows land on the upper body instead of a waist or thin
  air. A swing already arriving in the band is left as authored. Judge it with
  `node tools/aimheight.mjs "<battle url>"` (a fight played twice, servo off
  vs on, every landed blow reported as a fraction of the victim's height) and
  `node tools/aimshot.mjs <attacker> <victim> <out> [light|heavy] [dist]`
  (the impact frame frozen side-on, both ways).
- Paint jobs (`src/mechs/colorscheme.js` — 11 schemes, cycled in mech select):
  a scheme is a PAINT TARGET (hue + a saturation floor OR ceiling + the
  LIGHTNESS the paint wants), never a plain hue swap. The lightness is what
  makes the white/black/silver mechs work: each mech's armor is dragged 80% of
  the way to the scheme's value, so WRAITH's EMBER is really red instead of
  still black, while a mech already in the midtones barely moves. One source of
  truth for both routes — the procedural path rewrites `skin.primary.base/base2`
  and pbrtex re-synthesizes, `recolorglb.js` runs the SAME `schemeSat`/
  `schemeLum` over the baked GLB textures. Which pixels count as "the paint" is
  per-mech (`neutralMix`): a vivid mech's armor is its saturated stock-hue
  family; a near-grey mech's armor is the NEUTRAL pixels and its few saturated
  ones are accents to protect. Judge a change with
  `node tools/schemesheet.mjs <mech> out.png <schemeIdxCsv>`.
- Work-in-progress mechs: a roster def flagged `hidden: true` (currently
  AEGIS + NOVA) is kept out of the GAME's roster — mech select, RANDOM
  picks, CPU picks, title line-up — until SETTINGS → SHOW ALL ROBOTS is
  turned on (persisted in `rw.showAllRobots`). Every workbench (`?showcase`,
  `?rigedit`, pose/skin tools, `?battle=...`, the level editor) always sees
  the full `ROSTER`, so iteration is unaffected. Game code that offers mechs
  must go through `playableRoster()` / `isPlayable()` from `roster.js`.
- MECH-SELECT POSTERS (`public/posters/`, `src/ui/posters.js`): flipping
  through the roster shows a pre-rendered PNG per mech and builds no model;
  the real body appears after 0.7s of rest or on lock-in. A poster stands in
  for THE GLB (the default body — so that is what it must be rendered from,
  with alpha), framed through the select stage's own camera
  (`menustage.aimPreviewCamera`) and recorded as a world-space box off the
  mech's feet, which the runtime projects live so one render serves 1-4
  pickers. Regenerate with `node tools/posters.mjs` after any change to a
  mech's model, rig, rest pose or scale; it refuses to write a procedural or
  opaque poster. A NAMED run (`node tools/posters.mjs viper rhino`) MERGES into
  `posters.json` — it used to rewrite the map from empty, which deleted every
  other mech's box, and a mech with no box has no poster at all as far as
  `posterMeta` is concerned (mech select quietly goes back to building a model
  per keypress, with the unused .png still sitting on disk). Check the handover
  with
  `node tools/postercheck.mjs viper cranky,jerry <4 ids>` — it reports
  poster-vs-model drift in pixels per slot at each player count. NOTE any
  harness that builds preview mechs must `await loadManifest()` first, or
  `manifestHasGlb()` answers false and the stage quietly shows procedural.
- BAKING A MECH (`node tools/bake-glb.mjs <id> [--apply]`) folds every runtime
  edit — custom rig, skinOps, `seamCuts`, reparent, stretch, bonePos, rig posts —
  INTO the .glb, strips those manifest fields and deletes the rig file, leaving
  one revertible commit. `--apply` first archives the untouched asset to
  `public/models/source/<file>.glb` (once — a re-bake never overwrites the true
  original) and writes `public/models/source/<id>.edits.json`: every folded field
  with its values, plus the rig file's text, so a baked model stays explainable
  without digging through git. Paths come from the entry's `url`, not from the
  mech id (jerry's primary model is `mech_jerry_alt.glb`). A dry run restores the
  tree even if a step throws. THE BUILT-IN FIDELITY CHECK ONLY SEES THE 15
  JOINTS — it cannot see skinning or a glbanim `post` hook that stopped firing,
  so after a bake also run `tools/skindebug.mjs <id>` (same findings?),
  `tools/weldmap.mjs <id> --list` (same welds?) and re-render the poster.
  A baked model keeps its seam record as `rwSeam` mesh extras, so the skin audit
  still knows a deliberate split from a crack.
- Model set: the GLBs in `public/models/manifest.json` are the DEFAULT for
  every mech; `?debug=fallback` forces the procedural roster (also the
  automatic fallback for a mech with no manifest entry or a broken GLB).
  `?debug=3d` is the old opt-in flag and still means GLBs.
- ARENA PROP COST: props are an object-count problem, not a triangle one (they
  were ~45-80% of a frame's draw calls for 3% of its triangles, because each is
  a pile of small meshes and the toroidal wrap clones the lot into 8 neighbour
  cells). Three levers, each revertible on its own:
  `mergePropMeshes` (src/arena/props.js) bakes each placed prop's meshes
  together by material — after the colliders are measured, before the ghost
  clones — and `?props=raw` turns it off; `node tools/propopt.mjs [--apply]`
  shrinks the imported prop GLBs, keeping the untouched originals in
  `public/models/props/source/` (`--restore --apply` puts them back); and
  `preloadPropModels(themePropNames(theme))` fetches only the models the arena
  places instead of all twenty. The GLB diet is SIZE-PRESERVING: the decimation
  error budget tightens per model until the bounding box matches the original
  (`node tools/propopt.mjs --audit` proves it for all twenty, and FAILS on
  drift). Judge the models in `/workbench/?edit=props` — original and optimized
  in twin viewports with one shared camera, with triangle/texture/VRAM/file
  deltas and a size check; the mesh merge is judged by flipping `?props=raw`
  on a battle URL, since it changes draw calls and not pixels.
- Level builder: `?edit=level` (place/move buildings, props, terrain + export)
  · `?edit=level&load=<name>` edits `public/levels/<name>.json` ·
  `?battle=<theme>&level=<name>` plays an authored level. Editor: `src/editor/`,
  loader + authored-placement format: `src/arena/level.js`.

## Mech art pipeline — READ `docs/MECH_ART_GUIDE.md` FIRST

That guide is the master manual for turning concept images into in-game
mechs (both routes: external rigged-GLB services and the free in-engine
sculpted route), including **§5 THE CONTRACT** — per-mech joints/anchors
that combat silently depends on. Never rebuild a design without it.

## Architecture map

- `src/core/` — engine (renderer/loop/post-FX), pbrtex (PBR skin synth),
  textures (canvas tex), audio (WebAudio synth), music (the battle
  soundtrack: every file in `src/music/` is a song, listed by the `rw-music`
  vite plugin, filename = title — drop one in and it joins the rotation.
  STREAMED, not bundled: copied to `dist/music/`, fetched on demand.
  `?music=0` or a `RW_NO_MUSIC=1` build turns it off), utils.
  THREE TUNING LAYERS, don't confuse them: `tuning.js` = the GAMEPLAY DIALS
  every mech shares (stamina durations, pace, dash, guard arc, hit reactions
  — the file to edit for feel; costs are stated as SECONDS/fractions of a
  full bar and the per-second rates are derived), `config.js` = PLAYER
  settings the settings menu writes (robot speed, round time, music volume,
  persisted to localStorage), `mechs/roster.js` = PER-MECH balance.
  PUPPET ANY OF IT LIVE from the console — `rw.help()`: `rw.set(<CONFIG
  path>, v)` lands immediately (CONFIG is read at the point of use);
  `rw.tune(<TUNING path>, v)` stores a session override and reloads, because
  fighter.js snapshots nearly all of TUNING into module consts at load and a
  live write there silently does nothing (`?tune=a.b:1,c.d:2` is the same
  thing in a URL, `rw.tunes()`/`rw.untune()` list and drop them). An UNKNOWN
  url param now warns with a did-you-mean instead of being ignored —
  `core/knobs.js` owns the list and `node tools/params.mjs` fails if it drifts
  from what the source actually reads.
- `src/mechs/` — roster.js (ALL stats/palettes/skins/moves — balance lives
  here), designs/<id>.js (one file per mech; parallel-agent-safe), parts.js
  (sculpting vocabulary + Assembler), factory.js (rig + materials),
  animations.js + animator.js (pose-blend engine), gltf.js + rigadapter.js
  (GLB loading + humanoid retargeting), roster `skin` blocks drive pbrtex
- PER-ROUTE animation: when a move only works on ONE of a mech's two models,
  author it as a `GLB_CLIP_VARIANTS` entry compiled under the SHARED clip's name
  and point the mech's glbanim profile `clipOverrides` at it. The roster keeps the
  shared name, so every check keyed on `def.heavyClip`/`isPlaying`/the mirror
  alternation matches either build and the procedural one keeps the default.
  Colossus is the worked example (clap on the GLB, pound procedurally) — and note
  a clip in `SMASH_MIRRORS` needs its `*Mirror` name overridden too, or half the
  swings fall through to the shared clip
- `src/combat/` — fighter.js (state machine), specials.js (24 specials/ults
  by id), projectiles.js, effects.js (pooled VFX)
- `src/arena/` — themes.js (12 arena configs), arena.js, destructible.js
  (instanced chunk buildings), props.js
- `src/game/` — boot.js (screen flow), world.js, match.js, camera.js
  (combine/split), input.js, ai.js, predict.js (menu-idle prefetch: pre-ROLLS
  the RANDOM arena / robots / next song so the menus can consume the same
  values it downloaded — `?prefetch=0` off); `src/ui/` — menus.js, hud.js
- `public/models/manifest.json` — drop rigged GLBs here to override any
  mech's procedural model (auto-fallback if missing/broken)

## House rules

- Before committing: `git config user.email noreply@anthropic.com && git config user.name Claude`.
- Parallel agents may only fan out over `src/mechs/designs/<id>.js` and
  `src/arena/{themes,props}.js` — everything else is shared, single-writer.
- Verify visually (screenshots) before claiming art changes work; verify
  `npx vite build` + a soak before claiming combat changes work.
- RE-RIGGING NEVER LOSES ANCHORS. Muzzles/anchors in `manifest.json` are
  hand-placed by the owner: a new or edited rig re-expresses them on the new
  bones with the SAME rest-pose world position + aim, it never drops them or
  leaves them on stale numbers. Only a brand-new GLB with no authored muzzles
  may fall back to auto-generated ones. Prove it with
  `node tools/anchorkeep.mjs <id>` (`--remap R=<bone>,L=<bone>` emits the
  preserved numbers) — see MECH_ART_GUIDE §5.
- ALWAYS finish a task by merging your feature branch into `main` and
  pushing `main` — the owner plays off `main`, so work left on a branch is
  work they can't see. Push the branch too, then
  `git fetch origin main && git checkout -B main origin/main &&
  git merge --no-ff <branch>`, re-run the build, and push. (There is a
  stale local `main` with an unrelated history in some clones — always
  re-point at `origin/main` rather than trusting whatever `main` is
  checked out.)

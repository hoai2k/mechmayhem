  // WHICH WAY THE LEGS ARE POINTING — which is not always the way the body is.
  //
  // A mech in target-lock walks sideways and backwards while its chest stays on
  // the enemy. Until now the whole body turned as one, so a strafe played a
  // forward stride translated sideways (feet skating across the ground) and a
  // BACK-PEDAL played a forward stride translated backwards, which is the
  // "walking backwards looks wrong" report: the legs were pushing the way he
  // was going instead of against it.
  //
  // These are robots, so the answer is the one a person cannot do: TURN THE
  // HIPS. `drift` is the angle from the body's facing to its actual travel, and
  // the legs take it while the torso counter-rotates by the same amount, so the
  // lower body walks where it is going and the upper body still aims.
  //
  // …UP TO A POINT. Aimed almost straight back at the camera there is nothing
  // left to turn toward, so the OTHER answer applies: measure the drift against
  // the REVERSED facing (a 180° back-pedal becomes 0° of leg turn) and run the
  // walk cycle BACKWARDS, so he back-pedals with the feet pushing the right way.
  //
  // WHERE THAT LINE SITS IS THE WHOLE FEEL. It used to be a quarter turn, which
  // made "sideways with a little bit of backwards" a REVERSED cycle — a strafe
  // that walked backwards, which is not what a strafe looks like. It is 170°
  // now (LEG_BACK_ON): a STRAFE NEVER REVERSES, only a genuine retreat does, and
  // the hips are allowed the full 170° to get there.
  //
  // Crossing that line is a real half-turn of the pelvis — the two answers put
  // the legs on opposite sides of the body, so there is no sleight of hand that
  // makes it free — and it is DAMPED like every other leg turn, which reads as
  // the mech pivoting his lower body to back away. What keeps it from happening
  // twice a second is the 20° of hysteresis: he commits to the retreat at 150°
  // and does not come out of it until 130°.
  //
  // Humanoids only. A crab does not counter-rotate its waist, and neither does a
  // wolf on four legs — gated on the gait (`standard`/`sprint`) plus a roster
  // opt-out (`strafeLegs: false`) for the bodies that walk upright but are not

  // not that body — he jogs like a biped and gallops like a wolf, and there is

  // commits to four legs over `snap` seconds, below it he commits back, and the
  // only time he is in between is while that blend runs.
  //
  // HYSTERESIS is what makes it a state rather than a twitch. Without it, a mech

  // crosses it and the body shivers between gaits; the threshold to commit UP is

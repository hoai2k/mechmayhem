// FACIAL PERFORMANCE — for the mechs that have an organic face.
//
// Most of this roster is a machine: a visor, a lamp, a grill. KONGA and TRITONE
// are not. They have brows, eyes and a jaw made of meat, and a face that never
// moves reads as a mask — worse on them than on a robot, because the sculpt
// promises it should.
//
// TWO LEVELS, so the same performance survives both render routes:
//
//   HEAD GESTURE — driven through `tgt.head` (and a little `tgt.torso`), which
//     EVERY build has, procedural or GLB. A roar throws the head back, a snarl
//     drops it and shakes, a flinch snaps it aside. This is the layer that
//     carries the acting, and it works on a Tripo model with no face bones.
//
//   FACE PARTS — the `jaw`, `browL`, `browR` parts. The procedural designs
//     build them as virtual joints; the GLB route carries the same names as
//     real bones in rigs/<id>.rig.js, and `Animator.part()` resolves whichever
//     this body has. When neither exists the block is skipped in silence, so a
//     GLB with no custom rig simply performs with its head instead of breaking.
//
// WHY IT LIVES HERE and not in each mech's signature: the two faces want the
// same VOCABULARY (idle breath, snarl, roar, flinch, death slack) with different
// PROPORTIONS — a gorilla's jaw opens on a hinge under a heavy brow, a
// ceratopsian's beak opens wider and its brow barely moves. So the behaviour is
// shared and the numbers are per-mech (the `cfg` argument).
//
// Expression is chosen from what the body is doing, in priority order:
//   dead > flinch (hitstun) > roar (heavy/special/ult) > snarl (any attack)
//   > firing > idle
// and then DAMPED toward, never snapped — a face that teleports between poses
// reads as a glitch. Attack expressions ride the CLIP'S OWN PHASE (like cranky's
// pincer gape), so the mouth opens on the wind-up and is widest at the hit
// instead of drifting on a timer of its own.

    // is rebound to just the mandible, and the roar comes back with it.

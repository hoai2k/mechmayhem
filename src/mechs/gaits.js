// THE GAIT TABLE — the walk/run cycle as DATA, not as code buried in the animator.
//
// Every mech's locomotion used to be one hard-coded block of sines in
// animator.js: one set of amplitudes for a 6.5-speed colossus and a 13.5-speed
// viper alike, differing only by `ratio = speed / maxSpeed`. That is why the
// fast mechs read as stiff — at full throttle they ran the SAME stride a heavy
// runs at full throttle, just faster.
//
// A GAIT is a named bundle of those numbers. A roster def names one
// (`gait: 'sprint'`), several mechs SHARE one (that is the point: tune
// 'sprint' once and viper, tempest, wraith and nova all move), and a mech that
// names none gets `standard`. `applyGait()` below is the whole cycle, and it is
// what the animator runs — the gait workbench (`/workbench/?edit=gait`) drives
// this exact function, so what you tune there is what ships.
//
// SHAPE OF A GAIT
//   legs   the stride itself: thigh swing, forward reach, knee lift, track width
//   ankle  the foot roll and the toe-off push
//   arms   the counter-swing: shoulder pitch, elbow bend/pump, how tucked in
//   body   what the torso does with all of it: bob, pitch, lean, twist, head
//   quad   OPTIONAL — the four-legged gallop layer (fenrir), which rides on top
//
// EVERY NUMBER IS IN RADIANS unless the schema below says otherwise, and every
// `*Run` twin is the amount ADDED AT FULL SPEED (`base + run * ratio`), which is
// how a gait can walk politely and sprint hard without a second table.
//
// CONVENTIONS (the animator's virtual rig, see rigadapter JOINT_ORDER):
//   thigh/shoulder pitch  NEGATIVE = forward, positive = back — the SAME sense
//                          for an arm as for a leg, which is the trap that had
//                          the arms swinging with the legs (see applyGait)
//   knee pitch            POSITIVE = folded
//   thigh roll (z)        POSITIVE pulls the LEFT leg toward the midline
//                          (the right leg mirrors), so `adduct` narrows the track
//   head pitch            NEGATIVE = eyes up

 * How much this foot is IN THE AIR: 0 standing on it, 1 clear of the ground.
 *
 * FIRST CHOICE is the measurement: a calibrated body knows the real distance from
 * each boot to the pavement (Animator.soleClearanceBySide, handed over as
 * `env.footClr`), and nothing beats that — a deep-booted heavy can have its ankle
 * a quarter of a body height up with the sole still planted.
 *
 * WITHOUT ONE (procedural bodies, and the quadruped, whose hock calibrateFeet
 * skips) it falls back to how much HIGHER this foot hangs than the other one,
 * from the leg's own geometry: thigh and shin projected on vertical, both from the same hips.
 * The comparison is what makes it work without knowing where the ground is — a
 * walking body always has a foot down, so the LOWER foot is the one standing and
 * the other is up by the difference. (Absolute leg length cannot answer it: a leg
 * that shortens in stance is the body squatting over a planted foot, not the foot
 * rising, and reading it that way had every foot "airborne" all cycle.)
 *
 * Two reasons it is done from the pose rather than from the gait phase or a world
 * measurement:
 *
 *  · it is a fact about the FINISHED stride, so it does not care WHICH layer bent
 *    the leg. Fenrir's hinds are moved by the biped layer AND by a gallop running
 *    at its own rate (`quad.stride`); no single phase window describes where his
 *    paws are, and any gait added later would need its own.
 *  · it stays a pure function of the pose, so the gait workbench measures exactly
 *    what the game runs.

// A gait is one set of numbers scaled by `ratio`, which is enough for a body
// that does ONE thing faster. It is not enough for a body that does a DIFFERENT
// thing fast: fenrir jogs on two legs like a runner and gallops on four like a
// wolf, and those want different stride, different knees, different carriage —
// not the same numbers turned up.
//
// So a gait may carry a second copy of any of the four pose groups, under
// `runLegs` / `runAnkle` / `runArms` / `runBody`, and the gait MORPHS from the
// first into the second as the quadruped layer fades in (the same `q`, so the
// carriage and the gallop arrive together instead of fighting on the way).
// At the bottom the gait is exactly its base; at the top it is exactly the run
// table, which is what lets a hand-tuned gallop be restored verbatim and still
// have a sprinter's jog underneath it.
//

  // The numbers are then the no-skate solve, not taste. At full throttle he

  //     +sinL) runs while cos(ph) > 0, and mirrored for R. The weight is a
  //     smoothed half-cosine so plant and lift are crossfades, like footStates.
  //   · `foldClear` folds the elbow through the recovery swing (a front leg
  //     lifts to clear the ground coming forward, extends to plant)…
  //   · …and the WRIST does what an ankle does: `handGround` cancels the pitch
  //     the hips + shoulder + elbow stacked into the planted claw so it stays

// not a curve.
//
// A foot is doing one of three things (see footStates), and only the first of
// them is about the world:
//
//   ON THE GROUND   the sole belongs FLAT ON IT, whatever the leg is doing. That
//                   is the levelling ask back in applyGait (`footFlat` from the
//                   model's own foot depth, or `ankle.level` from the gait), and
//                   it is world-space: it cancels hips + thigh + knee.
//   PUSHING OFF     planted but behind the body — the toe stays down while the leg
//                   straightens and the heel comes up. The foot pivots over the
//                   toe, so it is NOT flat and NOT hanging: it is driven hard down
//                   relative to the shin (`ankle.push` + `pushRun`, and ~90 degrees
//                   is what a real push-off reaches).
//   IN THE AIR      nothing holds a foot at an angle to the world. It hangs off the
//                   shin at its resting angle — perpendicular, for a body built
//                   that way; whatever its own bind says, for a digitigrade one.
//                   `ankle.hang` points the toe a little past that, which is what
//                   a runner does (~15 degrees) and a walker does not.
//
// Both non-stance states are JOINT-space rules — stated relative to the shin, not
// to the horizon — so one number lands the same on a boot, a talon and a paw.
//
// It runs LAST, after the gallop layer, so it covers fenrir's hinds too, and it
// BLENDS rather than adds: the stance shaping (roll, tilt) is handed back as the
// foot leaves the ground instead of accumulating into a pose no ankle holds.

// THE TAIL — a wave travelling down a chain that is not part of the rig.
//
// A tail is not one of the 15 game joints. Nothing retargets onto it, the
// RigAdapter never touches it, and only a custom rig even has one (fenrir's
// blade is `tail0`…`tail5`, hanging off the hips). So it gets its own pass,
// gated on a gait carrying a `tail` block — every other gait is untouched and
// shows no tail dials at all.
//
// WHAT IT IS TRYING TO LOOK LIKE: weight on the end of a rope. The wag is
// driven off the GAIT PHASE rather than a clock, so it beats with the stride;
// each segment further out runs a little further BEHIND that phase (`lag`), so
// what you see is a wave travelling outward and a tip that trails rather than a
// rigid blade swinging as one. The vertical float runs at twice the rate, which
// is what a tail does — over and back once per stride sideways, up and down
// twice.
//
// STRAIGHTENING is the odd one, and it is measured rather than authored: the
// tail's resting curve lives in the rig's BONE POSITIONS, not in any rotation,

// THE OTHER FOUR LEGS.
//
// Same shape as the tail above, and for the same reason: a hexapod's extra legs
// are not the 15 game joints, nothing retargets onto them, and only one body has
// them. So the rig is MEASURED once (hexLegsOf) and a pure pass (applyHexGait)
// writes their angles into the pose target, which the animator then puts on the
// rig's own bones after the retarget has had its say.
//
// TWO THINGS ARE DERIVED RATHER THAN AUTHORED, because getting either wrong is
// invisible in the numbers and obvious on screen:
//
//  1. WHICH AXIS IS FORWARD — and there are TWO of them, which is the whole
//     difference between a crab and a short humanoid. Turn the leg about the
//     body's LATERAL axis and it swings under the hip like a pendulum: that is a
//     PUSH-OFF, and its lever arm is how far the foot hangs BELOW the hip. Turn
//     it about the body's UP axis and the leg swings ROUND the hip, flat, like a
//     hand on a clock face: that is what an arthropod does, and its lever arm is
//     how far the foot sits OUT from the hip. `hex.yaw` mixes the two, and both
//     levers are measured per leg so the mix can be costed rather than guessed.
//     All three axes are read off the rig itself (up from hips->torso, lateral
//     from the two back hips), so this works on a body facing any way with its
//     legs anywhere.
//  2. WHICH TRIPOD EACH LEG IS IN. An insect walks on alternating triangles —
//     front-left, mid-right, back-left, then the other three — which is just
//     "flip the phase for each rank down the body, and again for the other
//     side". Rank comes from where the hip actually sits along the body, so a
//     rig edit that moves a leg re-derives its place instead of quietly walking
//     the wrong triangle.
//
// The BACK pair is included in the measurement and NOT driven: it carries the
// game leg joints, so the stride above already owns it, and all it contributes
// here is its rank (the tripod parity the other four alternate against).

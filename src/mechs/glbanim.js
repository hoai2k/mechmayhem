// GLB animation profiles — per-model reinterpretation of the shared engine.
//
// WHY: the keyframe CLIPS in animations.js are authored for the PROCEDURAL
// rig — its rest pose, its proportions, its handedness (which hand holds a
// weapon, where a blade points). A Tripo GLB often differs: a weapon in the
// opposite hand, a sword fused to the forearm at an angle, a stance the auto
// rig bound in. Retargeting those clips verbatim warps the result.
//
// HOW: the Animator still drives the SAME virtual joints and the SAME timing
// (so combat hit-windows, muzzle anchors and state durations are unchanged —
// gameplay is identical). A profile only changes HOW a pose is expressed for
// one GLB, at four well-defined seams:
//
//   restPose    {joint:[x,y,z]deg}   overrides the default/idle stance
//   combatPose  {joint:[x,y,z]deg}   overrides the ready-guard stance. NOTE:
//                                     GLB mechs do NOT inherit the procedural
//                                     def.combatPose — the service models are
//                                     authored in their own battle-ready stance
//                                     (that IS their bind pose, which the
//                                     retarget offsets capture), so their native
//                                     carriage already reads as "guard up".
//                                     Retargeting the procedural combatPose on
//                                     top of that fights the bind and wrenches
//                                     fused geometry off-axis. Set this only to
//                                     opt a GLB back into an explicit stance.

//                                     remapped (redo, don't remap)
//   build(mech, def)                 one-time hook at the end of buildGlbMech —

//                                     into tgt / drive extra joints
//
// FACTORING CONTRACT:
//   • A change that should affect BOTH procedural and GLB  -> edit animations.js
//     (shared CLIPS) or the mech's def (roster.js).
//   • A change to a procedural mech's personality           -> animator.signature()
//   • A change to how ONE GLB interprets the shared motion   -> its profile here
//   • Static rest-pose alignment of a GLB (arms-down bind)   -> manifest
//     boneCorrections (via the ?debug=pose workbench's "Bind patch" export),
//     NOT restPose here — keep the two concerns separate so the pose workbench
//     stays the source of truth for bind.
//
// Procedural mechs have NO profile (mech.animProfile is undefined) and run the
// engine unchanged. Only GLB mechs (buildGlbMech) attach one.

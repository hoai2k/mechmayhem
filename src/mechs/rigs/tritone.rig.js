// TRITONE custom rig — a hand-placed skeleton for mech_tritone.glb, a
// cybernetic ceratopsian gun platform. Tripo's prerigcheck called this model
// `others` (not a biped) and the forced biped rig, while usable for walking,
// splits the body across chains that mean nothing: one rear leg has three
// links and the other two, the frill and the flank cannons ride bones that
// also carry chunks of hide, and there is no jaw or brow at all.
//
// The engine drives NINE non-joint parts on the procedural Tritone — jaw,
// both brows, the frill, both flank cannons and a three-segment tail — and had
// bones for none of them here. This rig gives every one a real bone and lets
// the proximity re-skin (reskin.js) redraw the weights from scratch.
//
// Positions are MESH-LOCAL (raw GLB bind space), read off the model:
//   +x FORWARD (beak, horns)   +y UP   +z LEFT / -z RIGHT
// The manifest's `yawOffset: 270` turns that into the game frame. Note how
// FLAT he is: the whole body spans y 0 → 0.40 while running x -0.5 → +0.5.
// That is the shape, not an error — he is a long low bridge on four columns.
//
// `skinSpan: 'child'` — a bone owns the slice beyond it, which is what makes
// a columnar leg bend at the right place.
//
// Bones that are NOT game joints:
//   jaw / beak         the lower jaw, hinged so jaw.rotation.x opens it
//   browL / browR      the bony eye ridges
//   frill              the neck shield + its rocket-tube crown (flares on a
//                      brace, jams forward as a shield on a charge)
//   cannonL / cannonR  the flank cannon assemblies (+ barrel tips to span along)
//   tail0..tail2       the armoured tail — driven by the gait's own tail layer
